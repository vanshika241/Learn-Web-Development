Node JS and runtime

1.ECMAScript - It is a scripting language specification(docs) on which JS based. It careate rule for JS which a compiler must follow 
guidelines and rules 
ES5, ES6 - Versions

2.JavaScript - It is a scripting langugae that conforms specification of ECMAScript(var, let , const , functions , conditionals) but it also constains additional features which are not part of ECMA ex DOM, setTimeOut but they are crucial for Webd.
implementaion 
JS Compilers Engine - V8 (Used inside google chrome in C) and SpiderMonkey(Used in FireFox in C+Rust) - must follow ecma standards 
Node js use V8
JS Code ->ENGINE->0s and 1s

3.Node js
Before we write html,css, js and js run on browser VB Engine and other language like Java and Go used for backend but then some smart people realized that let take out this V8 Engine and add some extra functionality which JAVA doing for backend ex Readfile , creating HTTP Server and thus JS now a backend language also and the environment which run JS on our machine is Node js run time(it run JS).

Nodejs is not a language not framework

4.Bun - 
Node js is generally slow, Bun is faster.
Competitor of Node js but much better its written in Zig

What can you we do with Nodejs - 
1.Create Clis (Terminal)
2.Create Video Player
3.Create a game
4.Create an HTTP Server(imp)

What is HTTP Server- 
Hyper text transfer Protocol
A protocol that is defined for machines to communicate (voice to zoom - zoom webdrtc protocol to our zoom account and we able to hear )
most common way for your website frontend to its backend
ex we search something and press enter then the request go to backend server(large data center) and then from their response come to our machine
protocol that helps to send request from frontend and response back to fronted from backend(Node js) is called HTTP Server.

HTTP Server- 
expose to internet or backend Models but it maintains authentication 
HTTP Server- some code that follows HTTP Protocol and able to communicate with clients(browsers)
ex callApp in phone
just like function - send input from clients , do some computation and return output

Clients need to worry about for HTTP protocol - protocol- http , https
-address or url , IP or ports backend server(https//google.com)
-Route 
-Headers , Body , Query parameter 
- Method
image 
Server need to worry about - 
- respond headers 
- respond body 
- status codes


Things happen in your browser after you send request 
 - Browser parses the url
 - Does a DNS Lookup(convert google.com to IP address) 
 - Establishes a connection to the IP(does handshake)

Things happen on your server after recieved request 
- You get input(route , headers , body)
- You do dome logic , computation used backend model and data 
- you return the output body , headers and status code

HTTP Methods - 
GET 
POST 
PUT 
DELETE

HTTP Status code - 
200 - everything ok - response successful
404 - page/route not found
403 - Authorization issues
500 - Internal Server error(bug,crash, request not processed from BE)

How do i cretae my own http server , 
my website - anyone can visit
